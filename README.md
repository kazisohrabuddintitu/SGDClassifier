# SGDClassifier
The SGDClassifier is a linear classifier in scikit-learn that implements a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for training.

I have tried to implement SGDClassifier on MNIST_784 dataset. Then applied PCA on the dataset with 95% variation ratio and implemented SGDClassifier on this dataset. It seems faster then the first model perspective of time.
